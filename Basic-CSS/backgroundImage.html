    <!--  
1. Difference between visibility:hidden and display:none? 
    <!-- Use visibility: hidden when you want to hide an element but keep its space reserved in the layout.

         Use display: none when you want to remove an element from the layout entirely, so it doesn't take up any space. -->

 
<!-- 2. Difference between inline and block level elements?  -->

    <!-- Block-Level Elements: Start on a new line, take up the full width available, and are used for larger structural components.

            Inline Elements: Do not start on a new line, only take up as much space as necessary, and are used for smaller content within a line of text. -->
 
<!-- 3. What are selectors?  -->
    <!--  Selectors are a fundamental part of CSS that allow you to apply styles to specific HTML elements based on their types, attributes,
       or relationships. Understanding and using selectors effectively can help you build well-structured and styled web pages. -->
